# Hypothesis Testing Results

## 1. Province Differences
- **Claim Frequency**: p < 0.001 (Statistically significant differences)
- **Claim Severity**: p < 0.001 (Statistically significant differences)
- **Highest Risk**: Gauteng (Frequency: 0.3%)
- **Lowest Risk**: Northern Cape (Frequency: 0.1%)

## 2. Gender Differences  
- **Claim Frequency**: p = 0.120 (Not significant)
- **Claim Severity**: p = 0.030 (Not significant)
- **Male Claims**: 0.0% frequency, R0 average severity
- **Female Claims**: 0.0% frequency, R0 average severity

## Recommendations:
1. Implement province-based pricing adjustments
2. Maintain current gender-based pricing
